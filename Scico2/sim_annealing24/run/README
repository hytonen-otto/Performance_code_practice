RUN INSTRUCTIONS:

Example run command:
time ./a.out 0.1 0.8 50  output1.dat output2.dat output3.dat

Command line inputs:
1. The initial value of the control parameter c. 0.1 gives good results
2. The cooling parameter alpha 0.8 gives good results
3. The number of boxes. A run with  50 boxes takes 1.5seconds, a run with 200 boxes takes 30 seconds
4. Filename for the file for drawing the initial positions of the boxes.
5. Filename for the file for drawing the final positions of the boxes. 
6. Filename for the file for the plot of the footprint as a function of iterations

Values 1 and 2 shouldn't be changed from 0.1 and 0.8 if the program is not changed. 
They are taken in from the cmd line because after tweaking the code these 
values are foud by trial and error.

IMPORTANT: If given a filename that already exists, the previous file is deleted 

A better visualization style for large number of boxes:
	In the inout module, comment line 130 and uncomment 131, compile

Program for drawing the positions of the boxes (filenames of cmd-line input 4 and 5):

The third output file can be opened with excel or other similar program.
